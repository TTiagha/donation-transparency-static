# Donation Transparency Platform Plugins

This repository contains the four core WordPress plugins that power the Donation Transparency platform, a system that connects "givers" (donors) with "receivers" (individuals or businesses seeking funding) through a transparent financial relationship.

## Key Feature: Complete Financial Transparency

What makes this platform unique is that **receivers make their bank transaction history completely visible to donors**, creating unprecedented accountability in how funds are utilized. The platform replaces trust with verification, allowing donors to make more informed decisions about who they support based on demonstrated spending habits.

## Four-Plugin Architecture

The platform follows a feature-based organization with four focused plugins that work together:

```
Base System → Financial Connections → Transactions & Donations → Discovery
```

### 2. Financial Connections Plugin

## Integration and Data Flow

The plugins are designed with clear integration points and a structured data flow:

2. **Financial Connections** handles external integrations and feeds data to the transaction system
3. **Transactions & Donations** processes and displays financial data to users
4. **Discovery** presents public-facing profiles and transparency features

## Documentation
