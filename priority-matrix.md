| Priority | Task                                                                                             | Impact & Justification                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---     | :---                                                                                             | :---                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **High**   | Consolidate `donor-confidence.html` into `building-donor-trust.html` and implement a 301 redirect. | **Highest Impact.** This action directly resolves a clear case of keyword cannibalization for high-value "donor trust" terms. It will consolidate page authority into a single, stronger asset, which should produce the most immediate and significant positive ranking signal. |
| **Medium** | Differentiate informational guides from commercial feature pages (titles, metas, internal links). | **Significant Impact.** This clarifies page intent for search engines, reducing a key source of ranking confusion. It enables our feature pages to rank for valuable commercial keywords while allowing our guides to capture top-of-funnel informational traffic, improving overall organic performance. |
| **Medium** | Clarify intent of "New Charity" vs. "First-Time Fundraiser" guides with new titles and metas.       | **Significant Impact.** This directly improves user experience and click-through rate (CTR) from search results by clearly stating the purpose of each guide. Clearer intent signals help search engines serve the right page to the right user, reducing bounce rates.                                |
| **Low**    | Refine and add an internal link from `building-donor-trust.html` to `community-local-fundraising.html`. | **Moderate Impact.** This is a minor optimization that fine-tunes the user journey and spreads a small amount of link equity. While good for site architecture, it addresses a low-severity overlap and will have a less pronounced impact on rankings compared to the other actions.  |
| **Low**    | Consider creating a new top-of-funnel blog post for "new charities."                               | **Future Strategic Impact.** This is a content gap recommendation, not a direct fix for an existing issue. This action will help capture a wider audience long-term but does not resolve any current cannibalization problems, hence the lower priority for this phase of work. |
